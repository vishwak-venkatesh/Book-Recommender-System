# Book Recommender System

This is a collaborative filtering based book recommender system that uses both user-based and item-based techniques. It provides book recommendations to users based on their reading history and the reading history of other users with similar interests.

## User-based Collaborative Filtering
In user-based collaborative filtering, the recommendations are generated based on the similarities between users. The system identifies users with similar reading habits and recommends books that they have liked but the target user has not yet read. This approach is effective in capturing user preferences and recommending books that they are likely to enjoy.

## Item-based Collaborative Filtering
In item-based collaborative filtering, the recommendations are generated based on the similarities between books. The system identifies books that are similar to the ones that the target user has liked and recommends those books. This approach is effective in capturing relationships between books and recommending books that are similar to the ones the user has enjoyed in the past.
